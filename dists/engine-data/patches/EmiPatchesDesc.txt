List of fixed bugs in EMI scripts:

+Others modifications:
	-Differently from Grim Fandango, global preferences (such as volume, subtitles, ...)
	in EMI are saved in a text file (at least in Windows reatil version and demo).
	Patches to _options.lua modifies this behaviour and hooks directly into ResidualVM
	configuration manager through GetResidualVMPreference and SetResidualVMPreference
	opcodes. For simplicity, these patches patches only load the file residualvm-prefs.lua,
	(they add a 'dofile("residualvm-prefs.lua")' at the end of _options.lua) see it for
	further details. At the moment, these modifications applies only to the demo
	and the Windows retail versions.

Contents of residualvm-emi-patch.m4b and its rebuild:

residualvm-emi-patch.m4b contains all .patchr files in the
dists/engine-data/patches/emi/ directory.
If you add a new patch in that directory, you have to update this file
with a detailed description of what that patch does.
Then you have to rebuild residualvm-emi-patch.m4b with mklab from the
residualvm-tools repo. The rebuild command is (assuming that you are
launching it in dists/engine-data/):

 $ mklab --emi patches/emi residualvm-emi-patch.m4b

Please check that there aren't any files different from .patchr inside
that directory before the rebuild, so delete all junk, backup and system
files, like namepatch.patchr~, namepatch.patchr.bak, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db
and so on.
