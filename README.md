## 1. What is ResidualVM?
ResidualVM is a game engine reimplementation that allows you
to play 3D adventure games such as Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island
and Myst III.

ResidualVM utilizes OpenGL for 3D graphics hardware acceleration.
A software renderer is also included for machines without hardware OpenGL.


## 2. Current state
At this point ResidualVM is fit for normal use, when playing supported
games, it is however worth noting that you should still save early, and
save often, as problems or dead-ends might still exist. (Grim Fandango
itself originally had a few unintentional ways to get the game stuck).

### 2.1. Which games does ResidualVM support? ###

Currently ResidualVM supports Grim Fandango and Escape From Monkey Island,
as well Myst III.

#### 2.1.1. GrimE-games support ####

Game                             | Status

## 3. Running GrimE games

### 3.1. Required files

For both Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, you will need the original
game files as well as the official update patch.

#### 3.1.1. Grim Fandango ####

You will need to copy the data files from your Grim Fandango CDs into one
directory. Specifically, you'll need:
  * All of the .LAB files from both CDs
  * A copy of the Grim Fandango 1.01 update EXE
        The patch can be downloaded from:
        http://demos.residualvm.org/patches/gfupd101.exe

#### 3.1.2. Escape from Monkey Island ####

You will need to copy the data files from your Escape from Monkey Island CDs
into one directory. Specifically, you'll need:
  * All of the .M4B files from both CDs.
    One of the files is easy to miss:
    local.m4b is located on CD1 in Monkey4/MonkeyInstall.
        Note: The file voiceAll.m4b is repeated on both CDs. Use the
              copy from the first CD, it contains all of the required
              voice data
  * The Textures directory, combined from both CDs. When copying, rename
    the FullMonkeyMap.imt files to FullMonkeyMap1.imt and
    FullMonkeyMap2.imt from CDs 1 and 2 respectively.
  * The Movies directory from each CD
  * A copy of the Escape from Monkey Monkey Island update EXE
    You will need a patch specific to the EMI version you're using:
  * "EFMI Installer" if you have the Mac version of EMI.

Italian    | http://demos.residualvm.org/patches/MonkeyUpdate_ITA.exe

#### 3.1.3. Escape from Monkey Island (PS2) ####

You will need to copy the data files from your Escape from Monkey Island DVD
into one directory. Specifically, you'll need:
  * All of the m4b files from the DVD
  * The Videos, demos, jambalay, lucre, melee and monkey directores


### 3.2. Running the game ###

1. Prepare the game directory as specified above
2. Open ResidualVM
3. Choose "Add Game"
4. Select the folder you created in Step 1
5. Click Start

If you want to play with software-rendering, see the configuration-section
below, or use the ingame settings to disable 3D Acceleration.

When launching the game for the first time, ResidualVM will perform a full
integrity check of your game data files. This can take a bit of time, but it
will not happen again on successive runs. This prevents bugs from incompatible
game data, and helps us to find game variants that we're not aware of.

### 3.3. Default Keyboard-settings ###

Key         | Binding
----------- | ---------------------------------------------
e,u,p,i     | Examine, Use, Pickup, Inventory
Arrow keys  | Movement
Shift       | Hold to run
Enter       | Selects items in inventory, conversation, etc
Escape      | Skips cutscenes, exits certain screens
.           | Skips dialogue
q           | Exit Dialog Menu
Ctrl + c    | Force Quit (from command-line)
Alt + x     | Quit (ingame)
Alt + enter | Switch between windowed-mode and fullscreen
F1          | Menu

### 3.4. Joystick/gamepad support ###

If you want to use a joystick or gamepad for navigation, the joystick support
of the engine needs to be enabled using one of the following two options:

  * start residualvm with "--joystick" parameter
  * add "joystick\_num=0" to the "[residualvm]" section of the configuration file
    (see section 5.1. how to find the file)

## 4. Running Myst III

### 4.1. Required files ###

You will need these elements from your game CDs or DVD :
  * M3Data directory
  * Data directory
  * The menu language file '[LANGUAGE].m3u' (DVD only)

When using the CD version, you will need to merge the 'Data' directories from
all four discs. Playing directly from the CDs is not supported.

The game must be at least version 1.1. For most releases of the game, the
update is already applied on the installation media, no action is required.
Otherwise, ResidualVM asks for the update to be installed and refuses to run
the game. The updates can be downloaded from
http://demos.residualvm.org/patches/.

The DVD version is multilingual, you can change the in-game language from the
game menu. However, you must choose the language of the menus by copying the
appropriate files. You have to copy the menu language file from your chosen
language folder on the disc. On the DVD, the menu language file can be named
'language.m3u' or '[LANGUAGE].m3u' depending on the release. It should
be copied to the 'M3Data/TEXT' folder. If the file is named 'language.m3u',
it should be renamed to the explicit language e.g. ENGLISH.m3u for English.

The required files must be organized in the following manner to be recognized:

    ├── Data
    │   └── *.m3a
    └── M3Data
        └── Various files and folders (including the DVD version's menu language file)

### 4.2. Running the game ###

1. Copy the necessary files to a folder on your Hard Drive
2. Open ResidualVM
3. Choose "Add Game"
4. Select the folder you created in step 1
5. Click Start

### 4.3. Input controls ###

The mouse is used to look around and interact with the ages.

Available keyboard shortcuts:

Key        | Binding
---------- | ------------------------------
Escape     | Original Myst III Menu
Ctrl + F5  | ResidualVM Menu
Space      | Skip cutscenes, interact
Ctrl + c   | Force Quit (from command-line)
Ctrl + q   | Quit (ingame)


## 5. Configuration
Currently, not all the settings for ResidualVM are available through the GUI,
if you have problems with getting anything to work, first try to pass the
settings from the command line, then, if that doesn't work, try to change your
configuration file manually.

### 5.1. Location of configuration file ###

By default, the configuration file is saved in, and loaded from:

Operating System     | Location
-------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Vista/7/8/10 | \Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ResidualVM\residualvm.ini
Windows 2000/XP      | \Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\ResidualVM\residualvm.ini
Unix                 | ~/.residualvmrc
Mac OS X             | ~/Library/Preferences/ResidualVM Preferences
Others               | residualvm.ini in the current directory

### 5.2. Interesting settings for GrimE games ###

The following settings are currently available in the config-file,
however some of them might not work with your current build. And
some of them might make ResidualVM crash, or behave in weird ways.

Setting        | Values            | Effect
-------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------
show_fps       | [true/false]      | If true, then ResidualVM will show the current FPS-rate, while you play.
last_set       | [set-name]        | The set you were last on, ResidualVM will try to continue from there.
last_save      | [save-number]     | The save you last saved, ResidualVM will have that selected the next time you try to load a game.
use_arb_shaders| [true/false]      | If true, and if you are using the OpenGL renderer ResidualVM will use ARB shaders. While fast they may be incompatible with some graphics drivers.
fullscreen_res | [desktop/WWWxHHH] | If set to "desktop" (the default), ResidualVM will use your desktop resolution in fullscreen mode. If set to a resolution such as "640x480" or "1280x720", that resolution will be used.


## 6. Troubleshooting, Known Bugs, Issues
Grim Fandango had a few issues when it came out, and a few new and exciting
issues when you try to run it on newer hardware. Some of these have been
fixed in ResidualVM, but ResidualVM itself also has a few new issues that we
know about:
http://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/blob/master/KNOWN_BUGS

Look below for help with these issues, and if you can't find help here, try
either the forums at our homepage, or IRC: #residualvm at freenode.

### 6.1. I played a bit, but can't start a new game! ###

This is because the last save and visited scene is stored in your configuration
file, either delete grim-fandango from the ResidualVM-menu, and re-add it, or
go to your configuration file, and clean out the last-save and last-set entries.

### 6.2. My Save Games don't work any more ###

Did you recently update to a newer build of ResidualVM?
ResidualVM is still a work in progress, which means that the save format might
change between builds. While attempts are made to keep save file compatibility,
this isn't always possible.

### 6.3. In fullscreen mode, the picture is stretched! ###

This is know issue, in future versions it will be resolved.


## 7. Debugging
WARNING: This section contains information about the various tools that
are included for debugging ResidualVM, this should not be necessary for
normal play at all! However, the curious might like to know how to access
these tool. Please use at your own risk!
