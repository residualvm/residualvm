1. What is ResidualVM?
----------------------
ResidualVM is a game engine reimplementation that allows you 
to play 3D adventure games such as Grim Fandango and Myst3.

ResidualVM utilizes OpenGL for 3D graphics hardware acceleration.
A software renderer is also included for machines without hardware OpenGL.


------------------------------
2. Current state of ResidualVM
------------------------------

2.1 - Which games does ResidualVM support?

and has partial support for Myst 3.

For more information, see the page on ResidualVM at the wiki page:

---------------------
3. Running ResidualVM
---------------------

3.1 - Required files
--------------------
You will need the data files for Grim Fandango, as well as the patch,
if your game is an older release.

Specifically you need these files from your Grim CDs:
*.LAB

3.2 - Running Grim Fandango
---------------------------
1. Copy the neccessary files to a folder on your Hard Drive
2. Copy the patch to a game folder
3. Open ResidualVM
4. Choose "Add Game"
5. Select the folder you created in step 1
6. Click Start

The patch can be downloaded from:
http://demos.residualvm.org/patches/gfupd101.exe
Simply download it and put gfupd101.exe in the same folder as the .LAB-files,
and you are good to go.

If you want to play with software-rendering, see the configuration-section below.


-----------------------------
4 - Default Keyboard-settings
-----------------------------
e,u,p,i    : Examine, Use, Pickup, Inventory
Arrow keys : Movement
Shift      : Hold to run
Enter      : Selects items in inventory, conversation, etc
Escape     : Skips cutscenes, exits certain screens
.          : Skips dialogue
q          : Exit Dialog Menu
Ctrl + c   : Force Quit (from command-line)
Alt + x    : Quit (ingame)
Alt + enter: Switch between windowed-mode and fullscreen
F1         : Menu


-----------------
5 - Configuration
-----------------
Currently, not all the settings for ResidualVM are available through the GUI,
if you have problems with getting anything to work, first try to pass the settings
from the command line, then, if that doesn't work, try to change your configuration file
manually.

5.1 - Location of configuration file
------------------------------------
By default, the configuration file is saved in, and loaded from:

        Windows Vista/7:
        \Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ResidualVM\residualvm.ini

        Windows 2000/XP:
        \Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\ResidualVM\residualvm.ini

        Windows NT4:
        <windir>\Profiles\username\Application Data\ResidualVM\residualvm.ini

        Windows 95/98/ME:
        <windir>\residualvm.ini

        Unix:
        ~/.residualvmrc

        Mac OS X:
        ~/Library/Preferences/ResidualVM Preferences

        Others:
        residualvm.ini in the current directory

5.2 - Interesting settings
------------------------------------
The following settings are currently available in the config-file,
however some of them might not work with your current build. And 
some of them might make ResidualVM crash, or behave in weird ways.

|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|Setting     | Values      | Effect                                              |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|show_fps    |[true/false] | If true, then ResidualVM will show the current      |
|            |             | FPS-rate, while you play                            |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|last_set    |[set-name]   | The set you were last on, ResidualVM will try to    |
|            |             | continue from there                                 |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|last_save   |[save-number]| The save you last saved, ResidualVM will have that  |
|            |             | selected the next time you try to load a game.      |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

6. Troubleshooting / Known Issues
---------------------------------
Grim Fandango had a few issues when it came out, and a few new and exciting 
issues when you try to run it on newer hardware. ResidualVM also has a few issues
that we know about, look here for help with them, and if you can't find help here
try either the forums at our homepage, or IRC: #residualvm at freenode

6.1 - The game runs really slow!
--------------------------------
Some gfx cards do not have a fast glDrawPixels access to zbuffer
implementation in their system driver.

Unix users may be able to achieve playable framerates by using Mesa 5.0 or
above, but people unable to upgrade or Windows users must use software
renderer. Software renderer is generally faster on modern platforms.

6.2 - I played a bit, but can't start a new game!
-------------------------------------------------
This is because the last save and visited scene is stored in your configuration
file, either delete grim-fandango from the ResidualVM-menu, and re-add it, or 
go to your configuration file, and clean out the last-save and last-set entries.

6.3 - My Save Games don't work any more
---------------------------------------
Did you recently update to a newer build of ResidualVM? 
Grim engine is still a work in progress, which means that it might
change between builds. 

6.4 - In fullscreen mode picture is stretched!
----------------------------------------------
This is know issue, in future versions it will be resolved.

7. Bug Reports
--------------
ResidualVM is currently rather young, and therefore still has a few bugs, many might
already have been reported, but should you find a new one, don't hesitate to report it.

7.1 - How, and where do I report bugs?
-------------------------------------------------
You can report bugs at our github-issue-tracker:
http://www.github.com/residualvm/residualvm/issues

Please read the Wiki regarding how to report bugs properly first though:
http://wiki.residualvm.org/index.php?title=Reporting_Bugs

Remember to always have the following information in your bug reports:
* Bug details, including instructions on reproducing it
* Language of game (English, German, ...)
* Platform and Compiler (Win32, Linux, MacOS, ...)
* Preferably also a link to a save game right before the bug happened.

normal play at all. But the curious might like to know how. Use at your
own risk.

9.1 How do I enable debug-keys/debug-mode?
-------------------------------------------------
To enable debug-keys, and debug-mode you will have to add the following
to your configuration file under your Grim Fandango-entry:
