Residual: A 3D game interpreter

What is Residual?
-----------------
Residual allow to play 3D games such as Grim Fandango.

Residual utilizes OpenGL for 3D graphics hardware acceleration.
A software renderer is also included for machines without hardware OpenGL.

Which games does it support?
----------------------------
Residual is a fairly slow developing project and is still very much considered
alpha. Currently it contains limited support for Grim Fandango.

It is possible, but far from promised, that the other LucasArts LUA-based
title 'Escape from Monkey Island' may be supported in the distant future.

How do I run Residual?
----------------------
As Residual is not yet stable, easy to use, or complete.
Some technical ability might be required.

It runs really slow !
----------------------------------------
Some gfx cards do not have a fast glDrawPixels access to zbuffer
implementation in the system driver.

Unix users may be able to achieve playable framerates by using Mesa 5.0 or
above, but people unable to upgrade or Windows users must use software
renderer. Software renderer is generally faster on modern platform.

What is the state of Residual? 
------------------------------
Basic gameplay works, including cutscenes. Parts of the game are playable,
but many features are either missing or unstable. Crashes are likely.

Grim Fandango currently playable to the end. (With quite a few glitches)

Some puzzles might be hard to complete currently.

Also beware that since Residual is currently in an alpha-state, there is
no guarantee that your saves will continue to work with newer builds.
